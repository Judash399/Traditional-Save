    This documentation covers the **public API only**. If you want to explore how *TraditionalSave* works internally read the codebase or something.

If you're a beginner and aren't sure how to use *TraditionalSave* yet, it's highly recommended that you first read through [The Basics](../../../the-basics/download).
